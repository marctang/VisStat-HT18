Materials for the PhD course *Visualisation and Statistical Analysis* held in the Faculty of Languages, Uppsala University, Autumn Term 2018.

## Week 1 (2018-09-24)

- [Slides](01-introduction/01.introduction-slides.html) (from your browser, press key 'f' for fullscreen, 'w' for wide format)

For homework, 

- Revise the [notebook](01-introduction/01.introduction-notebook.Rmd) from the session, and finish up the final session (vectors). A good way to work is to read through and predict what will happen in each chunk before running it.
- Then do the [homework](01-introduction/01.introduction-homework.html) exercises. The main two parts are (i) working out how to install a package (a collection of special functions that work together), and (ii) writing functions to encapsulate a sequence of commands to carry out a particular.... function.
- Read [Wilson et al. 2017](01-introduction/Wilson_etAl_2017_Good_enough_practices.pdf) and prepare a question or comment.

## Week 2 (2018-10-01)

- Revise the [Notes](02-good-enough/02.good-enough-notes.Rmd) (download these and open them with RStudio)
- Then do the homework exercises at the end of the markdown document. This has two parts:
  1. Wrangling the Kelly data from Språkbanken — try to read this data into R after exporting it from excel. It'll require some manual fiddling
  2. Writing a more complex function with lots of potential arguments
- Next week we start doing something interesting with the Kelly data

## Week 3 (2018-10-08) Data Structures and plotting

- Michael’s [tidied-up version of the Kelly data](03-data-structures/Swedish-Kelly_M3_CEFR.tsv) (tab separated values, use `read_tsv`) 
- The [homework](03-data-structures/03.homework.pdf)
- The notes from class in [html](03-data-structures/03.data-structures.nb.html) and [markdown](03-data-structures/03.data-structures.Rmd) format

## Week 4 (2018-10-15) Data wrangling

- The notes in [html](04.data-wrangling/04.notes.nb.html) and [markdown](04.data-wrangling/04.notes.Rmd)

## Week 5 (2018-10-22) Visualisation

- The [notes](05.visualisation/05.notes.nb.html) from class  and the [introduction to GREP](05.visualisation/05.grep-slides.html) slides
- I have set some [homework](05.visualisation/05.homework.pdf) after all. You will also need the following data: [numeral-frequency.tsv](05.visualisation/numeral-frequency.tsv). Please email this to me by Sunday evening.

## Week 6 (2018-10-29)

- Deriving summary statistics
- Plotting homework review

The notes are available in [html](06.same-or-different/06.notes.nb.html)

## Week 7 (2018-11-05)

The [notes](07.similarity/07.notes.nb.html) from class

Data for class exercise
- [wals_data.tsv](07.similarity/wals_data.tsv) 
- [distance.RData](07.similarity/distance.RData)

## Week 8 (2018-11-12)

The [notes](08.geography/08.notes.nb.html) from class
